faq:
  - question: "What is DevFest?"
    answer: "DevFest is a week-long series of technical workshops held by ADI
      culminating in an 18-hour hackathon. DevFest focuses on fostering community
      and helping new developers end the week with a completed project."
  - question: "Who can participate?"
    answer: "Any student from the Columbia community (SEAS, CC, Barnard, General
      Studies, or any of the graduate schools) can register and participate."
  - question: "Do I need experience?"
    answer: "Students of all experience levels are welcome! If you've never programmed
      before, the Beginner Track is perfect for you. If you have prior experience, sharpen
      your skillset by working on the Web Development Track, iOS Development
      Track, or Data Science Track."
  - question: "Where is the schedule?"
    answer: "The detailed schedule will be released closer to the start of the event on this website.
      The hackathon will begin on February 3rd."
  - question: "Do I have to come to the entire week?"
    answer: "No, but be sure to register and attend as many events as you can.
      We will have different company sponsors, tech talks, and activities every
      night, so come to as many as you can!"
  - question: "Will there be food?"
    answer: "Yes! There will be dinner served every night and food throughout the hackathon!
      If you have any food allergies, make sure to state them when you register, or just email us."
  - question: "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?"
    answer: "No! Just come with a willingness to learn something new :)"
  - question: "How big can my hackathon team be?"
    answer: "The maximum team size is 5."
  - question: "What if I don't have a team?"
    answer: "Don't worry! At the start of the hackathon, we'll hold a team-formation session."
